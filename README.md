# Intricare - Product Dashboard (Starter)

Starter project for Intricare Technologies front-end test (React + Vite).

## Features
- Fetch & display products from fakestoreapi
- Add (POST) / Edit (PUT) / Delete (DELETE) with local state updates
- Search by title and filter by category

## Setup
1. Save files into a folder (e.g., `intricare-dashboard`).
2. Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Notes
- fakestoreapi may not persist changes server-side; we optimistically update local state.
- Create a short 3â€“5 minute video showing the flows (fetch, add, edit, delete).

## Submit
- Zip the project or push to GitHub. Email link + video to `hr@intricaretech.com`.
